### Overview

This is my solution for the **Blog Preview Card** challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a simple and responsive blog card component based on a provided design.

I implemented hover effects to change the background color and added a subtle `scale` transformation on the avatar to make the UI feel more dynamic. While the layout was straightforward, I spent extra time fine-tuning the responsive spacing, especially padding and text alignment, to make sure it looked good on all screen sizes.

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a blog preview card that closely matches the provided design. The card needed to be fully responsive and include interactive hover effects.
